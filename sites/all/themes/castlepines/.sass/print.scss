 * Basic Print File
 *
 * This print file imports base and styleguide settings, while ignoring the rest
 * of the layout, structure, etc. The point of this is to make your print files
 * pretty.
 *
 * Here is a good article about print stylesheets:
 * http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/24/how-to-set-up-a-print-style-sheet/
 *
 * If you are lazy and didn't read that, basically hide stuff that people don't
 * need on a piece of paper(ie - Ads, menus, etc).
